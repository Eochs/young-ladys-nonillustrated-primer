# A Young Lady's (Non-)Illustrated Primer

### Problem:
* The web contains the best of humanity, but also the worst; and we do not want unfettered access to the darkest corners of the internet.
* We do not want advertising aimed at young women causing insecurity and depression.
* We do not want social media hooking their attention with AI-generated beauty wars, deceptive journalism, and promotions of ("Ant Mill")[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill] cultures.


### Solution:
* List of safe and trusted edu sources (e.g. Khan Academy)
* LLM embeddings powering query frontend that indexes into edu sources
* (Possible speech to text for spoken questions)
* Generative text model "transfer learned" on educational resources

### Background:
Having a daughter prompted me to think about the state of online learning and the myriad pitfalls of social media, advertising, and the rest of the modern miasma. In an ideal world, there would be internet time for exploration that enabled her to explore the best of human culture. However, there is currently a wide gap filled with various super-stimuli, skinner-boxes, and all manner of attention grabbing adversarial agents. The YLNP provides a fairytale bridge over the online trolls, whisking her right to the castle of higher learning so she doesn't have to wade through the swamp of online discourse.
